/*
Write a C++ program that will accept the following information for each team in a cricket or a football league.

General Information

Team name

Number of wins

Number of losses

For a cricket team, add the following information:

No. of fours

No. of sixes

No. of runs

No. of ties

For a football team, add the following information:

No. of goals

No. of ties

No. of penalties

Step:1

Enter this information for all of the teams in the league. Then reorder and print the list of teams according to their win-lose records. Store the information in an array of structures, where each array elements (i.e. each structure) contains the information for a single team.

Make use of a Structure to represent the variable information (either cricket or football) that is included as a part of the structure. This Structure should itself contain two structures, one for cricket â€“ related statistics and the other for football related statistics.

Note: use enum type in comparing menu options.

 

Note : Try executing the code in your own compiler to test for different inputs and get the desired output.
